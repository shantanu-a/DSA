You need to implement the STR method of building R-tree data structure and all its operations as explained in the paper. Build the structure over the dataset given in data.txt. This consists of 21 two-dimensional data points with one point per line. You can choose m=2 and M=4 as the parameters. Any other parameter can be chosen as per the recommendations of the paper or making an appropriate choice as per the dataset.

Then implement a pre order traveral of the tree you have build which prints the MBR values (top right point and bottom left point of the MBR being printed) for each internal node traversed, and prints the 2-D objects stored in them while traversing the leaf nodes. Clear distinction is to be made while printing, whether the node you are printing is internal node or external node.
